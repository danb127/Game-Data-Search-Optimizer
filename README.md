### 🎯 Project Overview
Dive into the intricacies of data search algorithms with the Game Data Search Optimizer. This project showcases the implementation, comparison, and optimization of linear and binary search techniques on an extensive dataset of game information, highlighting the balance between theoretical understanding and empirical performance.

### 📁 Repository Structure
- **src/**: The heart of our project, featuring Python scripts including `GameStructure.py` for defining game data structure and search algorithms.
- **data/**: Home to `games.csv`, our dataset comprising information on thousands of games.
- **docs/**: Documentation detailing project insights, algorithm comparisons, and setup instructions.

### 🔍 In-depth Analysis
Experience the performance of linear versus binary searches firsthand, with detailed analysis on their efficiency across different dataset sizes and structures.

### 🚀 Getting Started
1. **Clone the repository**: `git clone [repository URL]`
2. **Set up your environment**: Ensure Python is installed and navigate to the `src/` directory.
3. **Run the application**: Execute `python GameStructure.py` to see the algorithms in action.

### 📊 Performance Metrics
